##  ***Calculator* Input Section**:

- Below the header is the main calculator input section. This section consists of input fields where users can enter algebraic equations, expressions, or inequalities. The input section may include options for selecting different types of operations, such as solving equations, factoring, or simplifying expressions.
	- You can do one of four operations:
	
		- Simplify - The "Simplify" operation simplifies algebraic expressions or equations. It applies various simplification guidelines to reduce the expression to its only form. This can involve combining like phrases, factoring, canceling out not unusual elements, and making use of algebraic identities. Simplifying expressions makes them easier to recognize and work with, specially in further calculations or hassle-solving.
			- The "Solve" option assists users in solving equations analytically, supplying step-by using-step solutions or numerical approximations as wished.
			- The "Evaluate" gives you option to enter a number for each variable by using text boxes for each variable.
			- The "Lesson" option suggests you a lesson from the "Lessons" page.
		
		- Evaluate - The "Evaluate" operation calculates the numerical fee of an algebraic expression for given values of variables. Users can enter precise values for variables, and the calculator computes the result of the expression the use of those values. This permits users to replacement numerical values into expressions and achieve the corresponding output, facilitating numerical computations and analysis.
			- The "Solve" option shows the immediate solution for the equation as well as simplifying the equation.
			-  The "Step-by-Step" option assists users in solving equations analytically, supplying step-by using-step solutions or numerical approximations as wished.
		
		- Graph - The "Graph" operation plots algebraic equations or capabilities on a coordinate plane. Users can input equations in terms of variables, and the calculator generates a graphical representation of the function. 
			- The "Graph" option shows you a graph made for the algebraic equations.
			- The "Lesson" option suggests you a lesson from the "Lessons" page.
		
		- Solve - The "Solve" operation unearths the answers or roots of algebraic equations. Users can enter equations, and the calculator determines the values of variables that fulfill the equation. This includes locating real or complex solutions to linear equations, quadratic equations, polynomial equations, structures of equations, and more. 
			- The "Solve" option assists users in solving equations analytically, supplying step-by using-step solutions or numerical approximations as wished.
			- The "Lesson" option suggests you a lesson from the "Lessons" page.
			- The "Practice" option leads you to [[Practice tutor page]] 
		
	-  Math Symbols in Algebra Calculator:
		- + (Addition)
		- - (Subtraction)
		- * (Multiplication)
		- / (Division)
		- ^ (Exponent: "raised to the power")
		- sqrt (Square Root) (Example: sqrt(9))
		- < (less than)
		- > (greater than)
		- <= (less than or equal to)
		- >= (greater than or equal to)


## ***Function* Buttons:**

- Alongside the input and output sections are function buttons that allow users to perform specific algebraic operations. These buttons may include options for solving equations, factoring expressions, simplifying fractions, and other common algebraic tasks. Users can click on these buttons to execute the desired operation on the inputted equation.

## ***Graphing* Functionality:**

- Some versions of the Algebra Calculator page may include graphing functionality. In this case, users can visualize equations and functions by plotting them on a graph within the calculator interface. The graphing section typically appears below the input and output sections and allows users to customize the appearance of the graph, such as adjusting the scale and style.
