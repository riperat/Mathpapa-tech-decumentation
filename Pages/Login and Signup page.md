## Authentication Flow

- Users initiate the authentication flow by navigating to the login or signup page on MathPapa's website.
- Upon submitting valid credentials, the user's information is sent to MathPapa's authentication server for verification.
- If the credentials are valid, the server issues an authentication token, which is returned to the client application.
- The client application stores the token securely and includes it in subsequent requests to access restricted resources on MathPapa's website.

##  Endpoints and APIs

- **Login Endpoint**: `/api/auth/login`
    - POST request to authenticate a user.
    - Parameters: `email`, `password`.
- **Signup Endpoint**: `/api/auth/signup`
    - POST request to create a new user account.
    - Parameters: `email`, `password`, `username`.

##  Request and Response Formats

- **Request Format**:
    - JSON format for requests containing user credentials.
    - Example:
        `{   "email": "user@example.com",   "password": "password123" }`
- **Response Format**:
    - JSON format for responses containing authentication tokens.
    - Example:
        `{   "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." }`

##  Error Handling

- **Error Codes**:
    - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request parameters.
    - `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid credentials.
    - `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side errors.
- Errors:
	- The username and/or password you specified are not correct.
## Security Considerations

- All communication with MathPapa's authentication service should be encrypted using HTTPS.
- Passwords should be hashed before being sent to the server.
- Tokens should be securely stored on the client-side and transmitted via secure channels.
